# GitHub Integration Overview

This framework is a reusable GitHub Action that performs automated DevSecOps checks for C/C++ projects using:

- ML1: commit risk prediction
- ML2: static-analysis alert prioritization
- ML3: pipeline anomaly detection
- final decision engine: BLOCK, REVIEW, or PASS

## Purpose and Security Model

This integration supports two complementary governance modes:

1. Reactive detection on direct pushes to main.
2. Preventive enforcement on pull requests before merge.

This is useful for academic and production-style evaluations because it demonstrates both post-integration detection and pre-integration policy gating.

## Where Trigger Logic Lives

Trigger rules are defined in the target repository workflow, not inside this framework repository.

Typical event triggers:

- push to main
- pull_request
- optional workflow_dispatch for manual runs

The target workflow calls this framework with:

```yaml
uses: mrossmaree/ai-driven-devsecops-framework@main
```

## End-to-End Execution Sequence

1. A GitHub event occurs in the target repository.
2. The target workflow starts on a GitHub-hosted runner.
3. Source code is checked out.
4. This framework action runs and performs:
    - Cppcheck and Clang static analysis
    - ML1 commit risk inference
    - ML2 alert prioritization
    - ML3 metrics collection, training, anomaly detection
    - final security decision
5. Reports are generated under reports.
6. Artifacts are uploaded to the workflow run.
7. If final decision is BLOCK, the action exits with non-zero code and the job fails.

   K -->|PASS| N[Workflow succeeds]

   L --> O[Artifacts + failed check visible in Actions]
   M --> P[Artifacts + review output visible in Actions]
   N --> Q[Artifacts + pass output visible in Actions]
```

## Push and PR Behavior

### Direct Push to Main (Reactive)

- The commit has already been integrated.
- The workflow evaluates security posture after integration.
- If decision is BLOCK, the pipeline fails and signals non-compliance.
- The framework does not auto-revert code.

### Pull Request (Preventive)

- The workflow evaluates proposed changes before merge.
- If decision is BLOCK, the check fails.
- With branch protection requiring the check, merge is prevented.

### Push vs PR Governance Flow

```mermaid

   A[Direct push to main] --> B[Code already integrated]
   B --> C[Framework scans and decides]
   C --> D{BLOCK?}
   D -->|Yes| E[Pipeline fails, remediation required]
   D -->|No| F[Pipeline completes]

   G[Pull request] --> H[Framework scans before merge]
   H --> I{BLOCK?}
   I -->|Yes| J[Required check fails]
   J --> K[Branch protection prevents merge]
   I -->|No| L[Checks pass or review-only]
```

## Decision Outcomes and Their Effect

- BLOCK:
   - workflow fails
   - strong policy violation signal
- REVIEW:
   - workflow completes, but indicates manual review required
   - does not block by itself unless repository policy enforces it
- PASS:
   - workflow succeeds

## ML1 Diff Behavior in GitHub Actions

ML1 uses git diff logic to analyze changed C/C++ code only.

Diff strategy:

1. For pull requests, base and head SHAs are used.
2. For push events, ML1 falls back to HEAD~1...HEAD.

Important implications:

- Full history improves reliability for diff-based analysis.
- Use checkout with fetch-depth: 0.
- On very first commits (no parent), ML1 may skip diff-based analysis.

## Required Target Repository Settings

1. GitHub Actions enabled.
2. Branch protection enabled for preventive PR gating.
3. Required status check set to the security workflow job.
4. Workflow permissions:
    - contents: write if ML3 persistence is enabled.
5. Checkout depth:
    - fetch-depth: 0 recommended.

- scan-path: .
- ml1-high-threshold: 70

## Failure Conditions and What They Mean

- Final decision BLOCK:
   - workflow fails intentionally
- Tool execution warnings (for example, no C/C++ files):
   - workflow may continue with empty or low-signal outputs
- Missing or insufficient git history:
   - ML1 diff behavior can degrade or skip

## Troubleshooting Quick Guide

### Workflow did not trigger

- Verify event triggers in target workflow.
- Verify file path filters include modified file types.

### PR was not blocked

- Confirm final decision was BLOCK, not REVIEW.
- Confirm branch protection requires the workflow check.

### ML1 seems skipped on push

- Ensure checkout uses fetch-depth: 0.
- Ensure the branch has enough history for HEAD~1.

### ML3 persistence step failed

- Confirm workflow permission includes contents: write.
- Confirm event is push and branch is not main.

## Recommended Adoption Sequence

1. Start with workflow_dispatch and pull_request in a test repository.
2. Verify artifacts and security_decision output.
3. Enable branch protection required checks.
4. Add push-to-main trigger for reactive monitoring.
5. Tune thresholds using observed false-positive and false-negative patterns.
